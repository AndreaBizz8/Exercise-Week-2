The result first line is 0.6666666 because the symbol used is â€œ/â€ and means a normal division.
Python running that calculation will keep the decimal numbers.
The result of the second line is 0 because the symbol used is â€œ//â€.
Using that symboll you will always do a division but it will give back a result without decimal.
It will also always keep the same natural number even id the decimal is really near the sequent number.

#Explain the mistake in the following code:

#pi = x
#area = pi * radius ** 2
print('''Explain the mistake in the following code:
radius = input("Radius:")
x = 3.14
pi = x
area = pi * radius ** 2

With the first line gave to the variable "radius" a string instead of an integer so to correct it we have only to chang it.
Converting the first string into an integer putting the command int (and it will be like this:
radius = int(input("Radius:"))
x = 3.14
pi = x
area = pi * radius ** 2
print(area)

In this code is missing the symbol * in between the 3 and the brackets, and the last line to print the string that we want to see that is:
print(a) 
So running the code we will have only the result

#Exercise 7
#Explain the mistake in the following code:

Python says that it could not convert string to float.
To correct it we need to change the input into an integer adding the code int in front of float.

#Why does this code not calculate the average?
print('''Why does this code not calculate the average?
print(3 + 4 + 5 / 3)

Because there is just one input.
You need to put two input in this string as there will be 2 calculation to get the average.
First the sum then the division.
So we should change the string in:
print((3+4+5)/3)

Improve the code so that the output is to two decimal places.

print("%.2f" % z)
The output is with more than 2 decimal as we have not specify it.
To give to that output 2 deimal we have to put the code "%.2f" that give as result 2 decimal.
If we now print that code we will have the result with 2 decimals as follow''')

#Find at least three compile-time errors:

The errors are:
1. the value of the integer have to be between brackets as:
int(x=2)
2. On the second line you can not use the command print with capital letter
3. On the second line you cannot put 3 more variable on the same line separating them with the symbol comma","
4. On the third line you have not print a command, you should use the command:
    print ("xcubed =", int(x**3))
    we have also modify the line putting two of "*" that means exponentiation

1. Using the symbol " instead of â€œ
2. On the string print we have to put capital letter for X and Y as we have given them capital letter before.
3. The product of X and Y is"X*Y" and not "X+Y"
